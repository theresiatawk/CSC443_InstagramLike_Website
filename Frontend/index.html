                    Instagram Like is a free, online photo-sharing application and social 
                    network platform<br>acquired by me in the Web Development Class.
                    Instagram allows users to upload <br>photos through a website.
                    Users can add a caption to eachof their posts. Each <br>post by a user can be viewed by the public.
                    As with other social networking <br>.platforms, Instagram users can like and comment on others' posts
