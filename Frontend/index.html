                    Instagram Like is a free, online photo-sharing application and social 
                    network platform that was acquired by me in the Web Development Class.
                    Instagram allows users to upload photos through a website. 
                    Users can add a caption to each of their posts. Each post by a user can be viewed by the public.
                    As with other social networking platforms, Instagram users can like and comment on others' posts.
                    <!-- Instagram is not only a tool for individuals, but also for businesses. The photo-sharing app offers 
                    companies the opportunity to start a free business account to promote their brand and products. 
                    According to Instagram's website, more than 1 million advertisers worldwide use Instagram to share their stories and drive business results. 
                    Additionally, 60% of people say they discover new products through the app. -->
